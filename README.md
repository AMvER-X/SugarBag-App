🏆 GovHack 2024: Proactive Park Maintenance System
This application was developed as a submission for the 2024 GovHack, Sunshine Coast Challenge, centered on revolutionizing park maintenance for Sugar Bag Mountain and Mary Cairncross Scenic Reserve. The core objective was to implement a proactive, data-driven methodology to optimize trail longevity and resource allocation.

Solution 1: Gamified Trail Management (Focus: Sugar Bag Mountain)
This solution utilizes gamification and IoT data to manage rider traffic and mitigate wear on mountain bike trails.

Intelligent Trail Assignment: An algorithm dynamically assigns users to specific trails. Initial assignment is based on the user's perceived skill level, cross-referenced with real-time IoT device data indicating current trail usage. This system directs riders toward lesser-ridden trails to proactively distribute volume, thereby extending the maintenance cycle of heavily used paths.

Engagement Mechanism: A points-based leaderboard system encourages user participation. Riders earn elevated points for completing "challenge trails" (those needing traffic diversion), which are redeemable for park merchandise, fostering a community-driven maintenance effort.

Operational Dashboard: A staff-exclusive portal provides a comprehensive dashboard displaying IoT data readings. This platform uses data analytics to automatically assess trail condition and trigger alerts, notifying maintenance staff of specific sections requiring immediate attention.

Solution 2: Ecological Monitoring & Volunteer Program (Focus: Mary Cairncross) -STILL OUTSTANDING-
This proposed expansion applies the core data-driven concepts to walking trails, with an emphasis on ecological health and community engagement.

AI-Assisted Biodiversity Monitoring: Future integration will include Machine Learning (ML) models for image recognition, allowing users to upload photos to identify local flora. Users are rewarded for contributions, and park management can leverage this crowdsourced data for early detection of invasive species or noxious weeds.

Automated Volunteer Scheduling: The system is designed to integrate a volunteer management module that can automatically generate work schedules. This facilitates targeted notification of volunteers and park rangers to organize and execute necessary ecological control measures.
